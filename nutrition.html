            <h1>Keto Diet Plan</h1>
            <p> The Keto diet is a low-carbohydrate, high-fat eating plan designed to induce ketosis, a metabolic state where the body burns fat for fuel instead of carbohydrates. Typically comprising 70-75% fat, 20-25% protein, and 5-10% carbs, this diet aims for rapid weight loss and has been associated with various health benefits, including improved mental clarity and reduced hunger.</p>

            <h1>Atkins Diet Plan</h1>
            <p>The Atkins diet is a low-carb eating plan divided into four phases, starting with a strict limit on carbohydrate intake to kickstart weight loss. As participants progress, they gradually reintroduce carbs while focusing on high protein and healthy fats. This flexibility allows for a personalized approach to weight management, making it easier to maintain in the long term.</p>
